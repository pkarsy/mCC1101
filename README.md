# NOTE
I no longer maintain this library, the basic limitation is that is working and tested only on atmega328. My efforts are now on
https://github.com/pkarsy/CC1101_RF which is portable to other architectures and has more options.

# mCC1101

An Arduino library for TI CC1101, a very capable and flexible sub GHz transceiver.

It is based on Panstamp library and has the same license : LGPLv3 or later.

It has many simplifications and some additions, compared to the original panStamp library.
However an Arduino board using mCC1101 can communicate without problems with a module using
the Panstamp library.
- The default frequency is 433Mhz. Use setCarrierFreq to set other baseband frequency.
- The ccpacket struct is removed. The sendPacket and getPacket functions use byte buffers.
- Removed the save-to-EEPROM functionality. It is now
responsibility of the developer to save the RF parameters (if such a need exists).
- Now the interrupt flag is part of the mCC1101 class. This allows member functions to manipulate it.
- New function sendBurstPacket to send a burst of identical (And usually very short) packets mainly to wake up from WOR mode.
This method can have some advantages (in some scenarios) over transmitting an unmodulated baseband signal.
- New function print. For example<br/>
rf.print(F("Elevation=%d Size=%d"),30,5);<br/>
will send a RF packet containing "Elevation=30 Size=5".<br/>
This function is useful when the PC has a bridge (***usb2rf module***) receiving RF packets and feeding the data to a serial port. See https://github.com/pkarsy/rfboot for details.

***Installation***

```sh
# Change this with your actual libraries directory
cd ~/sketchbook/libraries/
git clone https://github.com/pkarsy/mCC1101.git
```
